# Drinker Paradox
A proof for Drinker Paradox using Coq. It is a theorem of classical predicate (first-order) logic. Instead of using classical tactics, I declare the middle excluded axiom explicitly.

## The Paradox
"In a non-empty pub, there is someone such that, if he is drinking, then everyone is drinking"

It can be found on Raymond Smullyan's "What the name of this book?".
